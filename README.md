# Chess Enabled

The best chess experience on Earth

## Notice

This game is currently a work in progress. There is still much to be desired in the frontend, like improved UI and voice control.

## Get Started
* Either access the deployed site at <https://chessenabled.netlify.app>, or follow the steps below to build it yourself
* Configure AJAX endpoints in `./nuxt.config.js` _and_ `./server.js`
* `yarn generate` to generate static website files
* `yarn start` to start the local web server
* `yarn dev` if you want hot code reloading
* Access the local web server at <http://localhost:3000>

## Using the Site
* Create an account to play with others and track your elo
* Click `Play chess` to join the queue and match with others
* When a match is found, click `Accept` to accept the match, then wait for your opponent to do the same
* The chess game will now start, and each of you have 10 minutes to make moves
* You win by either conquering the opponent's king or letting the opponent's timer run out
